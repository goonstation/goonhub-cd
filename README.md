# Goonhub CI (Continuous Integration)

This is a little dinky node server wrapper over a bunch of bash scripts that are
responsible for compiling Goonstation, as well as the ancillary services such as
CDN files.

What you see here is a collection of legacy code grandfathered in from over the
past decade, as well as smattering written hurriedly over a weekend. As such,
quality is dubious, and comments are sparse. This tool is provided as-is and
you, the reader, and not expected to be able to run this in any capacity without
the underlying server architecture and supporting services.
